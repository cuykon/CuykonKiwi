# Version: Seed  2.5.0

## Intro

Wassup, Cuykoners! How's going? For me very well because THERE, IS, A, NEW, UPDATE! This will be more of a bug-fix update than a real novelty, but still A, NEW, UPDATE. It's mostly about data synchronization, fixing various bugs both functional and stylistic. Since the introduction is over, I suggest you scroll down, or admire for eternity this initial cluster of characters.

## ⚙️ Record Synchronization
Yessir, from now on you’ll be able to see your record updated in real time from any device connected to your account. No more uncoordinated records between devices. Register to receive this magnificent advantage! Had a higher record locally? Towel and Gatorade to get it back!

## 🎨 Minimal UI Improvements
With this update I also tried to give a slight refresh to the site’s design, making it a bit more interactive and stylistically elaborate. The result isn’t on par with a Van Gogh painting, but what did you expect from someone with a minimalist philosophy?

## 🌙 Dark Mode Improvement
After 1 year I decided to completely redo the JavaScript structure that manages the main button’s dark mode, making it simpler and more expandable in the future. With this new system you’ll benefit from the fact that the theme will be automatically preset from your last access!

## 🖱️ Custom Cursor:
The default computer cursor had little personality, so I preferred to replace it with a unique one for the site. I was mainly inspired by Mickey Mouse’s hand, with its white glove and smoother, cartoon-like lines. I hope you like it!


## 📃 Summary (Version: Seed 2.5.0):
