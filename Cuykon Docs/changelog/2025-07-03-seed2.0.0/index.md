# Version: Seed 2.0.0

## Intro

Wassup Cuykoners! How's it going? Hope you're doing great.
Over the past few months, I’ve been working on a new update to improve the experience across the site and evolve Cuykon into a more elaborate project. With this changelog post, I can finally announce that the work is public and you can see it live on the main site!

Authentication system, records, leaderboard, sharing with friends—and expect much more to come.
P.S. I’ve left a few bugs on the site. The challenge I’m giving you is to find them and report them to me on Discord or on the dedicated GitHub repo! </br>
**(Discord role up for grabs for true explorers!)**


## 🔐 Authentication System
For true fans of the project: from now on you can register on the site and enjoy the one power currently granted to you—the Leaderboard!
Soon I’ll be introducing newsletters, push updates so you get notified in real time, and maybe… ranks?
Check out the roadmap to find out what’s coming next!

## 📈 Records
Clicking is cool and all, but what's the point if it’s just about hearing sounds and smashing a button online?
So I added records so you can say: “Hmm, today I feel like beating my score.”
Here we go. Enjoy it!

## 🏆 Leaderboard
Cuykon used to be just a button that played sounds every 50 clicks, but something was missing: competition!
So I decided to add this mechanic to spice things up.
Right now there’s a global leaderboard, but in the future I’ll try introducing local ones.
For now, I'm taking a break :).
Of course, the leaderboard saves your highest record.

## 🍂 Sharing with Friends
You clicked for 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 year—and you want to show it off to your friend to prove how strong you are: now you can!
Wait 10 seconds after your last click so the record gets saved (in case you broke it), and share your score with your friend to show them who's the best.
Mh, go ahead—give it a try.

## 📊 Status Page
To be more professional and polished, I’ve created a status page so you users can monitor service uptime, accessibility, and scheduled maintenance.
(There may even be some Easter eggs during those events—who knows!)
So, before smashing your device, check if the services are working.

## 🧾 Summary (Version: Seed 2.0.0)
### Changes:
- Multiple bug fixes (stylistic and functional)
- Added authentication system
- Added leaderboard and record tracking
- Added legal notes regarding data handling, terms of use, and cookie policy

See you in the next update!

(Leeeeeeebrooooon) 🏀🔥
