# Origins

**Cuykon** is a project created in 2024 by a young student who had an idea while exercising. So he grabbed his computer and started looking for courses, guides... but at least one year of study and work was needed before a real result.

Since it was just a test, a pleasure without obligation, he asked the AI for an initial draft. «It kinda sucked», even considering that the graphics were made in just 5 minutes. After months of work, with strong help from modern tools, he managed to turn his crazy idea into reality, getting a big dose of personal satisfaction too.

This is Cuykon, a project that may look simple on the surface, but behind the scenes hides long workdays, whiteboards full of notes, and hours and hours of debugging. Sure, the AI gives you the code instantly, but it only works after you’ve tried it 10 more times, with logs and error messages... Simple on the surface, but many desk dents were made.

# What Is Cuykon?

Wassup, Cuykoners! Hope you’re doing well. Want to know what the game’s all about? Perfect.

**Cuykon** is a web-based game where you click a button, and every 50 clicks a random sound gets triggered based on the button’s theme. The more you click, the higher your counter goes, and you’ll unlock new awesome sounds. What are you waiting for? If you’ve made it this far, you probably already know the link—otherwise, here it is: “Link”.

Oh, and if you register, there’s an awesome leaderboard where you can compete with other registered users!
If you're tired of clicking, wait 10s and the system will save your score, if it's a record.

# Name Origin

**Cuy-kòn**, with the accent on the second syllable, like Minecon for fellow Minecraft fans (like me). The name has a bit of lore behind it—not Tolkien-level, obviously.

Cuykon comes from a wordplay between **“Click on”** and **“Quick-on”**. The reason is simple: when you see a button, you click it and speed up to raise the counter. Expected something deeper? Well, too late, this is the story. No elves, wizards or stuff like that.

# The Buttons

Right now the site features **5 different buttons** (plus a few that appear on special occasions):

- **Classic (Cuykon)**: the main button—the first one you see. It doesn’t stick to one genre, but mixes various meme-style sounds.
- **Chill**: I came up with it while sitting in a sauna. The name speaks for itself: just relaxed sounds tied to nature or instruments labeled as “chill”.
- **Anime (Naruto)**: I watched Naruto and liked it so much I had to make a button. The sounds are inspired by the famous anime series with a meme twist.
- **F1**: As a racing fan, leaving out a button like this would’ve been heresy. You’ll hear Charles Leclerc screaming, Ricciardo’s “kikira”, or the Ferrari pit wall making random calls.
- **Squid Game**: This one wasn’t just hype-fueled... okay, it actually came from a contest where the most liked comment decided the new button theme—and this is what came up. Gunshots, creepy dolls, and “I’ve played this game before” will be your soundtrack during the session.

# Philosophy

**Cuykon** aims to provide **5 minutes of light-hearted fun**, simple and easy, no complicated rules or game mechanics. The project uses a basic interface to express greater simplicity and chill vibes... sure, there might be sounds that give you mini heart attacks because they’re unbalanced, but that’s Cuykon :)
